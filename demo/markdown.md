## Development

Run the `develop:init` task:

```sh
yarn develop:init
```

```js
const foo = require("foo");
console.log("hello world");
```

This will create a symlink in the VS Code extensions and build the theme for the first time. Afte running this, follow the Installation instructions to load the theme.
